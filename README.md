# Sinus-Detection
The sinus disease dataset comprises a diverse array of cases featuring exhaustive imaging studies, including CT scans and MRIs obtained from several persons, each representing a unique subject. All of them were carefully annotated by radiologists. This collection serves as a valuable resource for both research and educational purposes. It reveals critical insights into the diagnosis, classification, and management of a wide spectrum of sinus conditions. 

To curate a focused dataset specifically for sinus disorders, we undertook a thorough review and selection process. We systematically filtered through the extensive Radiopaedia.org repository, which contains images related to numerous medical conditions. Our efforts involved carefully identifying, categorizing, and extracting only the most relevant and high-quality sinus-related images. This meticulous curation ensured that our resulting dataset was both comprehensive and specifically tailored to sinus pathologies, thereby optimizing its utility for our research objectives in AI-assisted diagnosis of sinus disorders. 

The data is distributed across two classes: Healthy, consisting of $37$ instances, and Unhealthy, consisting of $100$ instances, for a total of $137$ samples. Imaging data were collected from 137 participants, with scans obtained from multiple clinics to ensure diversity in the analysis. The source website contains hundreds of images spanning a wide range of diseases, and we carefully curated the dataset to include only those related to sinus diseases. It provides a diverse and comprehensive set of data for analysis. The conditions span chronic sinusitis (e.g., maxillary, rhinosinusitis, sphenoidal) and fungal sinusitis (allergic, non-invasive, and secondary infections). Additionally, the dataset includes structural abnormalities, such as the deviated septum, concha bullosa, and paradoxical middle turbinate, as well as more complex cases with complications like Pott Puffy tumor, orbital abscesses, and venous thrombosis. Normal cases are also included, ensuring a baseline for comparison.

The dataset contains both coronal and axial views, offering a range of perspectives critical for accurate diagnosis. However, the distribution appears to favor pathological cases, with a significant representation of chronic and fungal sinusitis, potentially introducing a class imbalance that should be considered during model training. The diversity of conditions and inclusion of rare complications make this dataset particularly valuable for developing diagnostic tools for sinus-related conditions.
